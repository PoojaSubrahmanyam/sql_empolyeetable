# SQL PROJECT ON EMPLOYEES DATASET



## PROJECT INTRODUCTION
In this SQL project, I have developed a comprehensive set of queries to analyze and manage a relational database that simulates a company's employee and department structure. The project utilizes an SQL database with multiple tables — emp, dept, and salgrade — which represent employee records, department information, and salary grading, respectively. The project is designed to showcase a wide range of SQL querying techniques, from basic selection and joins to advanced window functions and analytical queries. By applying these queries, I demonstrate the ability to work with real-world data, perform in-depth analysis, and extract meaningful insights for business decision-making.

## Key Project Details:
Database Schema: 

The project uses three main tables:

emp: Contains employee information such as 
ID, name, job title, salary, commission, manager ID, and hire date.


dept: Includes details about the departments, such as department number, name, and location.


salgrade: Stores salary grade information, with associated salary ranges.


SQL Queries: A series of 30+ complex queries that address various business needs, ranging from basic data retrieval to advanced analytics.


Techniques Applied:

Aggregation (COUNT, SUM, AVG)

JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)

Subqueries and Correlated Subqueries

Grouping and Sorting (GROUP BY, ORDER BY)

Window Functions (RANK, PARTITION BY, SUM() OVER)

Date Manipulation and Formatting

Conditional Logic (CASE WHEN)

Objective: The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in SQL, enhance data analysis skills, and solve practical database-related challenges efficiently.
